# 🛡️ Security Strategy for the Messaging Application

A messaging application with payments must be secured at multiple levels: authentication, data storage, communication, and protection against attacks. Here is a complete strategy to ensure your application is secure.

## 🔐 1. Authentication Security


### 📌 Using JWT (JSON Web Token)
- Implement stateless authentication with JWT (access token + refresh token).
- Access token with a short lifespan (~15 min).
- Refresh token with a longer lifespan (~7 days).
- Secure token storage:
  - Access Token → Volatile memory (React Native SecureStore)
  - Refresh Token → HttpOnly Cookie (managed by backend)

### 📌 Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
- Option to enable two-factor authentication (2FA) via email or SMS.
- Google Authenticator as an advanced option.

### 📌 Brute Force Protection
- Limit login attempts using rate limiting on the API (`express-rate-limit`).
- Temporarily lock the account after multiple failed attempts.

## 🔒 2. User Data Security


### 📌 Password Encryption
- Use bcrypt (hashing with a strong salt).
- Enforce a strong password policy: 8+ characters, uppercase, number, special character.

### 📌 Sensitive Data Storage
- Encrypt emails and other critical information using AES-256.
- Never store payment information! (Stripe handles this)

### 📌 GDPR & Privacy Compliance
- Allow users to:
  - Download their data.
  - Permanently delete their account.
  - Manage their privacy preferences.

## 🔄 3. Communication Security


### 📌 Message Encryption
- Use Stream Chat, which provides built-in encryption.
- Implement end-to-end encryption (E2EE) if necessary with libsodium.

### 📌 Enforcing HTTPS
- All exchanges between the app and backend must be done over HTTPS with a valid TLS certificate.

### 📌 Protection Against MITM (Man-In-The-Middle) Attacks
- Verify SSL/TLS certificates on the client-side.
- Enable HSTS to enforce HTTPS.

## 🛑 4. Payment Security (Stripe)


### 📌 PCI-DSS Compliance
- Never store banking information.
- Use Stripe Webhooks with signature verification.

### 📌 Fraud Protection
- Utilize Stripe’s anti-fraud tools (`Radar`).
- Enforce 3D Secure verification for payments.

## 🔥 5. Protection Against Attacks


### 📌 Preventing XSS & CSRF Attacks
- Sanitize all user input before rendering.
- Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict scripts.
- Use CSRF Tokens to protect sensitive requests.

### 📌 Preventing SQL Injection
- Always use prepared statements with Sequelize/MySQL.
- No dynamic SQL queries with user inputs.

### 📌 API Security
- All REST endpoints must be protected by JWT
- Implement roles and permissions (`Coach`, `Athlete`, `Admin`).
- Rate limiting to prevent API spamming.

## 🏗️ 6. Infrastructure Security


### 📌 Docker & Security
- Run containers with minimal permissions.
- Never expose the database publicly.

### 📌 **Backups & Recovery Plan

- Automatic database backup daily.
- Deploy on a secure server with an active firewall.

### ✅ Best Practices Summary

✔️ JWT + MFA for authentication  
✔️ Password encryption with bcrypt  
✔️ Mandatory HTTPS + HSTS  
✔️ Secure payments via Stripe and Paypal paiement
✔️ Protection against XSS, CSRF, and SQL Injection  
✔️ Strict API permissions management  
✔️ Regular backup
